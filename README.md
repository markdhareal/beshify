# Beshify ðŸ¤¸ 

It is a Desktop application that will put a tumbling emoji in every space of a sentence. This Application was developed using python and customtkinter (a modern python UI-LibraryÂ  that is based on tkinter). The developer got this idea from other developers out there who also worked on the same project. The idea originated when a [video clip](https://www.tiktok.com/@gmanetwork/video/7250348417757613313 "Credits: gmanetwork") of two kids became a trend here in the Philippines.
